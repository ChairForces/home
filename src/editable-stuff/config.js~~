    url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06300",
    notes: "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are inspired by their classical counterparts, but beyond heuristic considerations, the usefulness of such a concept \
            has yet to be rigorously demonstrated. We show that in the case of decoding quantum information from quantum error-correcting codes, \
            QNNs can provide an almost quadratic improvement in readout error over traditional stabilizer-based quantum error correction, \
            thus establishing a clear scenario where quantum AI methods such as QNNs are proven to provide an advantage over conventional non-AI methods.",

    present:require("../editable-stuff/Disco_2022_neurips.png"),
    notes: "We constructed a statistical mechanical theory that quantified the effect of imposing arbitrary network weight-distribution constraints. \
            Our theory predicted that the network capacity was proportional to the geodesic distance between the imposed and the original distribution on the Wasserstein statistical manifold, \
            and further predicted optimal prior distributions for achieving the best generalization performance. Our theory and the accompanying algorithm provided a geometric approach to study learning under constraints. ",

    url:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02346",
    present:require("../editable-stuff/MBL_Born_poster.png"),
    notes: "We proposed a class of quantum generative models that we have named “MBL hidden Born machines”. We proved that the trainability of basic Born machines could be tremendously improved by including hidden units, \
            and that the MBL Born machine possessed more expressive power than classical models. Our work revealed relationships between learning and physical dynamics that could serve as guiding principles for designing quantum generative models. ",

    title: "Discriminative learning by out-of-equilibrium many-body systems",
    url:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03623",
    notes: "We demonstrated that driven spin-glasses could perform a wide range of discriminative learning tasks that were usually only seen in digital systems, such as classification, memory, and novelty detection. \
            We further demonstrated that traditional thermodynamic variables were no longer effective in characterizing these novel many-body learning phenomena, \
            and that machine learning could make better predictions by using macroscopic variables constructed from nonlinear combination of traditional ones.",
